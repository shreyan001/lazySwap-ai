# LazySwap üöÄ

LazySwap lets anyone swap crypto assets across chains by sending a simple text message in Telegram groups or DMs. Powered by AI, it understands everyday swap requests (e.g., "Swap 0.1 ETH to USDC"), gives instant quotes via SideShift API, and provides wallet addresses with a secure QR page for payment.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Effortless swaps**: Just message your swap request in a Telegram group or DM‚Äîno app installs or browser extensions
- **AI-powered**: Chat in plain English, bot interprets intent, clarifies questions, and automates quoting/swapping
- **QR code payment**: Every swap comes with a secure QR page and wallet to pay; swapped tokens sent to your address
- **Group support**: Swap management and notifications in community chats (private/public)‚Äîideal for DAOs, hackathons, and social groups
- **No custody, instant settlement**: Users control recipient wallets, and SideShift API handles asset delivery
